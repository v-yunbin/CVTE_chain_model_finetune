The optional-silence phone sil occupies 26.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 82.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 10.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 3.3 hours of data, or 2.4 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 6.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (3,7.8,28)
